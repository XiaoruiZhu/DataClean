    <div class="field-value">The shoe tower was 99 centimeters using 17 shoes.<br />T = 5.82</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="bc138c6704df801"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">Please provide an in-depth description of the process you went through in building the Shoe Tower, including number of attempts and revisions.</span><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I began by stacking pairs of shoes flat on their soles with each subsequent layer's toes pointing in alternating directions.  So for example, the first layer's toes would point north, then the second layer's toes would point west then the third layer's toes would point north again and so on.<br />There were two problems with this method: <br />1.)  The tower grew too slowly per pair of shoes added because they are stacked horizontally (flat) <br />2.) The tower became unstable after a few layers because some shoes (especially boat shoes or fashion sneakers) couldn't bear much weight and would give and cause the collapse of the tower<br />I built about 10 towers with this method, I improved the height of the tower by using sturdier (dressier) shoes at the bottom of the tower and lighter shoes higher up the tower. Each tower collapsed after a few layers and each subsequent layer did not add sufficient height to the tower. The rate of growth per layer was too little and structural instability kicked in too quickly, eventually leading to a collapse.<br /><br />My final solution involved using two layers of shoes stacked vertically - one layer anchored on the very base of the tower and another one at the very top of the tower - to improve the height of the tower while using fewer shoes. In between the two vertically stacked layers, I used horizontally stacked shoes like before.<br />The benefit of this method was, the tower grew quickly before it became unstable enough to collapse, and it required fewer shoes. In addition, the four shoes stacked vertically at the base of the tower looked relatively nice.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="field-value">I'd rate it a 6. <br />I'm assessing by comparison - looking at other towers posted in the forums.</div>

    <div class="field-value">I'd rate myself a 6. There's a lot of room for improvement.<br />I'm taking of points for underestimating the effort involved and not assessing the task early enough to be able to iterate over enough solutions to maximize tower height. If I had started early enough and spent a few more days on the task I'm sure I could make the tower taller.<br />I want to be a 10 or at least a 9 by the end of this course.</div>
